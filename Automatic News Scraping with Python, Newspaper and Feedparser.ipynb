      "Plans for an upgraded NHS App to allow more patients in England to book treatments and appointments will be part of a package of measures unveiled by the government on Monday. The changes will allow patients who need non-emergency elective treatment to choose from a range of providers, including those in the private sector. Ministers and NHS leaders will publish this week what is described as an elective reform plan designed to speed up planned treatment. But the British Medical Association (BMA) said there was a risk the policy would \"discriminate or alienate\" patients who did not have access to digital technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan will set out how the government intends to meet one of its key election pledges – for more than nine in 10 patients to have their treatment or be signed off within 18 weeks of a referral by the end of this parliament. Currently fewer than six in 10 are dealt with in that time. The aim will be to reduce significantly the overall waiting list which stands at just under 7.5 million. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the move will shift the NHS \"into the digital age\" and help cut waiting times \"from 18 months to 18 weeks\". The plans would \"put patients in the driving seat and treat them on time\", and they would be \"put in control of their own healthcare\", Mr Streeting said. Action will also be taken to tackle missed appointments, which can be costly for the health service, including an artificial intelligence pilot to help pinpoint patients that may need extra help to attend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Health said the NHS app would allow more patients needing non-urgent treatment to view and manage appointments. The first step of the plan will come into force in March, when patients at more than 85% of acute trusts will be able to view their appointments on the NHS app. Reminders would be sent out by hospitals to reduce the number of appointments missed. Diagnostic tests could be booked at specialist centres with the results coming through more quickly. They will also be able to contact their healthcare provider and receive regular updates, including how long they are likely to wait. Patients already have the right to choose where they would like their treatment, including in the private sector, but are not always told that. Details of NHS and independent providers will be made clearer through the app. Some of these features are already available on the NHS app and a website Manage Your Referral. But officials say just 8% of bookings are made through these platforms. Other plans include expanding a scheme for GPs to discuss some cases with hospital specialists before making referrals to ensure patients are treated in the right setting. The current Advice and Guidance Scheme has resulted in 50% of cases being directed to more appropriate care rather than being put on long waiting lists and so reducing pressure on hospitals. These include some ear, nose and throat conditions. GPs will also be able to refer patients with certain conditions directly for tests or scans without the need to see a consultant first. The aim is to reduce waiting times and remove those who are given the all clear from waiting lists.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's the picture of domestic bliss. The Duchess of Sussex, picking flowers, slicing veggies and decorating cakes in a trailer for her new Netflix show. There's also a scene where she harvests honey, and hugs her husband, Prince Harry. Meghan, it appears, has rebranded herself. Her new look is described by public relations expert Chloe Franses as similar to the \"trad wife\" social media trend, inspired by 1950s housewives. In that sense, it is a departure for Meghan, who has been known as a feminist and a Hollywood actress. But Frances says it's actually a return to Meghan's roots, as the duchess used to be a lifestyle blogger before she married Harry. And as ever with Meghan, it's proving divisive. Franses praises it as \"authentic,\" while Alex Silver, a media relations expert, calls it \"tone deaf\". So what's the reason for her new TV show, With Love, and will it work?\n",

      "Reuters Harry and Meghan met in 2016 and married in 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most striking things about the trailer is that it's Meghan on her own, rather than with Harry. Since stepping down as senior royals in 2020 and moving to California, the pair have pursued various ventures together, including starting a production company and charitable foundation. Where do Harry and Meghan get their money? But with this new show, it looks like the couple increasingly want to do their own thing professionally - and to create two separate income streams. \"They seem to have separated their brands,\" says Pauline Maclaran, professor of marketing and consumer research at Royal Holloway. \"I think it's likely to be much more successful, because I think the two of them together weren't really getting any strong recognition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving away from royal connections\n",
      "\n",
      "The relaunch also signifies a move away from royal life. Since stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghan have continued to talk about the monarchy - including in their 2021 Oprah Winfrey interview and Harry's book Spare. But in this new TV show, Meghan \"isn't drawing on her royal connections\" anymore, says Maclaren. Instead, it focuses on lifestyle and wellness - areas she already explored before she met Harry through her lifestyle blog The Tig. On The Tig, Meghan shared beauty, diet and fashion tips, recipes, travel advice, and words of wisdom about love and life. Meghan Markle: The wellness guru she could have been The Tig was closed in 2017, but PR experts have said that returning to lifestyle could be a smart move. \"This is a well-trodden path for a woman in the public eye who has a lifestyle that straddles aspirational as well as challenging,\" Frances says. Others are more sceptical.\n",

      "\"There are more interesting and significant world events that are happening, which she could be talking about,\" Silver says. \"She could've been raising awareness for charitable work or something. \"I think she is all about herself. As a publicist, I can't understand how she can't read a room.\" Experimenting in the world of lifestyle has also backfired for some others in the public eye. Brooklyn Beckham's debut photography book was roundly mocked on social media, for instance - with one picture of an elephant receiving particular ire.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's about her own commercial interests'\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not Meghan's first foray into the business world - an industry fraught with risk and reward. The couple's previous business initiatives include a multi-million pound deal with Netflix. They appeared in another Netflix show, called Harry & Meghan, about their relationship. Both were also named as executive producers for the recent Polo documentary, but it drew low ratings from critics including in The Guardian and The Telegraph. Spotify's big bet on Meghan also fell flat. In July 2023, the streaming giant and the Sussexes's Archewell Audio announced they were parting ways in a mutual decision. At the time, experts suggested there hadn't been a big enough audience for Megan's Archetypes podcast to justify keeping it going. Last March, she launched a different lifestyle brand called American Riviera Orchard. It currently has more than 600,000 followers on Instagram, and features nine posts from when it launched - but there have been no posts since then. With this new venture, some have speculated that Meghan is hoping to open up further business opportunities for herself, such as partnerships with major supermarkets and brands. If so, she would be following in the path of others such as Hollywood A-lister Gwyneth Paltrow, with her hugely successful lifestyle platform Goop. \"This is clearly all about her own commercial interests,\" says Silver. \"They're aware their income is going to dry up at some stage. Their lifestyles are quite lavish, they're mixing in upmarket circles and they don't want to be the poor relation.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Nigel Farage has defended Elon Musk after the billionaire attacked the UK government's response to grooming gangs on X, the social media platform he owns. In a series of posts over several days, Musk suggested Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute gangs and said Home Office minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\". It came as the Home Office defended its decision to reject a request for it to lead a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. The Conservatives and Reform UK have called for a wider national inquiry. Asked about Musk's comments on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Farage said he had used \"very tough terms\" but that \"free speech was back\" on X under his ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farage was also pressed on his wider relationship with Musk, who is said to be considering donating money to his Reform party. Musk's latest intervention on UK politics came after Phillips, a safeguarding minister within the Home Office, instructed Oldham Council to launch its own local inquiry into historic child sexual abuse in the town, similar to inquiries set up in Rochdale and Telford. The local authority had called for a government-led inquiry. The tech tycoon seized on the decision, which was taken in October, and began heavily criticising the British government online. He suggested Sir Keir had failed to properly prosecute rape gangs while director of public prosecutions (DPP), and has repeatedly shared posts from Reform and Conservative MPs calling for a national inquiry. Musk, who is a key advisor to incoming US President Donald Trump, called the prime minister \"two-tier Keir\" and accused Phillips of being a \"rape genocide apologist\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch: Nigel Farage: 'People are angry about grooming gangs'\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Phillips as \"fearless and formidable\" and someone who has campaigned \"tirelessly for justice for those badly let down by endemic institutional failure\" for many years. Asked about the comments, Farage said \"tough things get said... by both sides of the debate\". He continued: \"This man happens to be the richest man in the world, but equally, the fact that he's bought Twitter now actually gives us a place where we can have a proper open debate about many things... We may find it offensive, but it's a good thing, not a bad thing.\" Earlier this week, Farage distanced himself from Musk's support for Tommy Robinson - a far-right activist who is serving a jail term for committing contempt of court.\n",
      "\n",
      "PA Media Reform party treasurer Nick Candy, Farage and Musk met at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property last month\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday morning, Farage said the public is \"absolutely right to be\" angry about grooming gangs. He went on: \"I just think people ask themselves, what has happened to our country? How could this possibly have happened? Why did everybody want to cover it up? Why has there been no full public inquiry?\" In a letter seen by the BBC, Phillips and Cooper wrote to the Conservatives setting out why they had asked Oldham Council to set up its own inquiry, rather than grant its request for a government-led one. The previous Conservative government turned down a similar request in 2022. The letter pointed out the local authority had already started setting up its own inquiry, and added that victims have said \"loud and clear\" they want action. \"In Oldham the crimes committed by grooming gangs were horrific,\" they wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young girls were abused in the most cruel and sadistic way. Victims and the community need to know that all steps are taken to deliver justice and protect children properly in the future.\" They said they supported an independent review commissioned by Mayor Andy Burnham, which covered historic abuse in Oldham and led to a new police investigation, as well as other child protection work across Greater Manchester. The letter highlighted the work of the Child Sexual Abuse Inquiry, which published its final findings in 2022. It made clear that \"abuse must be pursued and challenged everywhere with no fear or favour\" - whether in care homes, churches, homes or by grooming gangs. Professor Alexis Jay, who led that inquiry, said in November she felt \"frustrated\" that none of its 20 recommendations to tackle abuse had been implemented more than two years later. On Friday, Health Secretary West Streeting said the government was getting \"on with the job\" of implementing the recommendations \"in full\" since taking office in July.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been several investigations into grooming gangs in various parts of England, including Rotherham, Bristol, Cornwall and Derbyshire. An inquiry into abuse in Rotherham found 1,400 children had been sexually abused over a 16-year period, predominantly by British Pakistani men. An investigation in Telford found that up to 1,000 girls had been abused over 40 years - and that some cases had not been investigated because of \"nervousness about race\". Police figures from 2023 reveal that group-based child sexual abuse accounted for 3.7% of all sexual offences against children reported to police. According to the data, 26% of group-based child sexual abuse happened within families, compared with 17% involving groups including grooming gangs.\n",

It's up against Conclave, based on the 2016 novel by Robert Harris, which depicts a group of gossipy and scheming cardinals who gather in Rome to select the new Pope. Nickel Boys, about two young men forced to attend a reform school in 1960s Florida, and September 5, which dramatises the terror attack on the 1972 Munich Olympics from the perspective of the sports journalists who covered it, are also in the running. The other drama contenders include the sandy sci-fi sequel Dune: Part Two and A Complete Unknown, about Bob Dylan’s rise to fame in the 1960s. Blockbusters including Deadpool & Wolverine, Twisters, Inside Out 2, Gladiator II and The Wild Robot will compete for the cinematic and box office achievement award, which was introduced last year to recognise more mainstream films. Dune: Part Two was not submitted in that category despite its huge financial success, reportedly because the film's producers wanted Globe voters to focus on its artistic merits. That means if members want to vote for the film, they will have to do so in the main categories.\n",

      "There's a much higher chance of an actor being nominated at the Globes, where there are 36 slots available, than at the Oscars, which have 20. As a result, the Globes are able to lean in to big celebrity names, ensuring their ceremony is well attended by A-listers, not all of whom will necessarily go on to score an Oscar nomination. British acting nominees this year include Daniel Craig (Queer) Kate Winslet (Lee), Ralph Fiennes (Conclave), Cynthia Erivo (Wicked) Hugh Grant (Heretic), Tilda Swinton (The Room Next Door) and Felicity Jones (The Brutalist). They are joined by stars including Angelina Jolie (Maria), Nicole Kidman (Babygirl), Demi Moore (The Substance), Glen Powell (Hit Man), Timothée Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) and Zendaya (Challengers). There are two pop stars in the race - with Ariana Grande (Wicked) and Selena Gomez (Emilia Pérez) both in the running for best supporting actress.

Glaser said she was \"absolutely thrilled\" to be hosting the Globes, adding she was looking forward to getting a \"front row seat\" at \"one of my favourite nights in television\". \"It's one of the few times that show business not only allows, but encourages itself to be lovingly mocked (at least I hope so).

      "\n",
      "Sixty-year-old Chinese grandmother Su Min had no intention of becoming a feminist icon. She was only trying to escape her abusive husband when she hit the road in 2020 in her white Volkswagen hatchback with a rooftop tent and her pension. \"I felt like I could finally catch my breath,\" she says, recalling the moment she drove away from her old life. \"I felt like I could survive and find a way of life that I wanted.\" Over the next four years and 180,000 miles, the video diaries she shared of her adventures, while detailing decades of pain, earned her millions of cheerleaders online. They called her the \"road-tripping auntie\" as she inadvertently turned into a hero for women who felt trapped in their own lives. Her story is now a hit film that was released in September - Like a Rolling Stone – and she made it to the BBC's list of 100 inspiring and influential women of 2024. It was a year of big moments, but if she had to describe what 2024 meant to her in a single word, she says that word would be \"freedom\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Su Min Su Min's newest SUV is her third car in the four years she has spent on the road\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Su Min started driving, she felt freer, she told the BBC over the phone from Shenyang – just before she headed south for winter in her new SUV with a caravan. But it wasn't until 2024, when she finally filed for divorce, that she experienced \"another kind of freedom\". It took a while to get there: it's a complicated process in China and her husband refused to divorce her until she agreed to pay him. They settled on 160,000 yuan ($21,900; £17,400) but she is still waiting for the divorce certificate to come through. But she is resolute that she doesn't want to look back: \"I'm saying goodbye to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The road to freedom\n",
      "\n",
      "In her new life on the road, Su Min's duty is to herself. Her videos mostly feature only her. Although she drives alone, she never seems lonely. She chats with her followers as she films her journey, sharing what she has been cooking, how she spent the previous day and where she's going next. Her audience travels with her to places they never knew they would long for – Xinjiang's snow-capped mountains, Yunnan's ancient river towns, sparkling blue lakes, vast grasslands, endless deserts. They applaud her bravery and envy the freedom she has embraced. They had rarely heard such a raw first-hand account about the reality of life as a \"Chinese auntie\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're so brave! You chose to break free,\" wrote one follower, while another urged her to \"live the rest of your life well for yourself!\". One woman sought advice because she too \"dreams of driving alone\" and an awe-struck follower said: \"Mom, look at her! When I get older, I'll live a colourful life like hers if I don't get married!\" For some, the takeaways are more pragmatic yet inspiring: \"After watching your videos, I've learned this: as women, we must own our own home, cultivate friendships far and wide, work hard to be financially independent, and invest in unemployment insurance!\" Through it all, Su Min processes her own past. A stray cat she encounters on the road reminds her of herself, both of them having \"weathered the wind and rain for years but still managing to love this world that dusts our faces\". A visit to the market, where she smells chili peppers, evokes \"the smell of freedom\" because throughout her marriage spicy food was forbidden by her husband who didn't like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Su Min Su Min in a traditional outfit when she visited her home province, Henan, in January 2024\n",
      "\n",
      "For years Su Min had been the dutiful daughter, wife and mother – even as her husband repeatedly struck her. \"I was a traditional woman and I wanted to stay in my marriage for life,\" she says. \"But eventually I saw that I got nothing in return for all my energy and effort – only beatings, violence, emotional abuse and gaslighting.\" Her husband, Du Zhoucheng, has admitted to hitting her. \"It's my mistake that I beat you,\" he said in a video she recently shared on Douyin, TikTok's China platform. A high school graduate, he had a government job in the water resources ministry for 40 years before retiring, according to local media reports. He told an outlet in 2022 that he beat his wife because she \"talked back\" and that it was \"an ordinary thing\": \"In a family, how can there not be some bangs and crashes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When duty called\n",
      "\n",
      "Su Min married Du Zhoucheng \"really to avoid my father's control, and to avoid the whole family\". She was born and raised in Tibet until 1982, when her family moved to Henan, a bustling province in the valley along the Yellow River. She had just finished high school and found work in a fertiliser factory, where most of her female colleagues, including those younger than 20, already had husbands. Her marriage was arranged by a matchmaker, which was common at the time. She had spent much of her life cooking for and looking after her father and three younger brothers. \"I wanted to change my life,\" she says. The couple met only twice before the wedding. She wasn't looking for love, but she hoped that love would grow once they married. Su Min did not find love. But she did have a daughter, and that is one reason she convinced herself she needed to endure the abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Su Min Su Min learned to surf in the waters off the coast of Hainan in February 2021\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are always so afraid of being ridiculed and blamed if we divorce, so we all choose to endure, but in fact, this kind of patience is not right,\" she says. \"I later learned that, in fact, it can have a considerable impact on children. The child really doesn't want you to endure, they want you to stand up bravely and give them a harmonious home.\" She thought of leaving her husband after her daughter got married, but soon she became a grandmother. Her daughter had twins – and once again duty called. She felt she needed to help care for them, although by now she had been diagnosed with depression. \"I felt that if I didn't leave, I would get sicker,\" she says. She promised her daughter she would care for the two boys until they went to kindergarten, and then she would leave. The spark of inspiration for her escape came in 2019 while flicking through social media. She found a video about someone travelling while living in their van. This was it, she thought to herself. This was her way out. Even the pandemic did not stop her. In September 2020, she drove away from her marital home in Zhengzhou and she barely looked back as she made her way through 20 Chinese provinces and more than 400 cities. It's a decision that has certainly resonated with women in China. To her millions of followers, Su Min offers comfort and hope. \"We women are not just someone's wife or mother… Let's live for ourselves!\" wrote one follower. Many of them are mothers who share their own struggles. They tell her that they too feel trapped in suffocating marriages – some say her stories have inspired them to walk out of abusive relationships. \"You are a hero to thousands of women and many now see the possibility of a better life because of you,\" reads one of the top comments on one of her most-watched videos. \"When I turn 60, I hope I can be as free as you,\" another comment says. A third woman asks: \"Auntie Su, can I travel with you? I'll cover all the expenses. I just want to take a trip with you. I feel so trapped and depressed in my current life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'Love yourself'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you have the life of your dreams?\" Su Min pondered over the call. \"I want to tell you that no matter how old you are, as long as you work hard, you will definitely find your answer. Just like me, even though I'm 60 now, I found what I was looking for.\" She admits it wasn't easy and she had to live frugally on her pension. She thought the video blogs might help raise some money – she had no idea they would go viral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Su Min's stories have touched millions of Chinese women who feel trapped in their own lives\n",
      "\n",
      "She talks about what she's learned over the years and her latest challenge – finalising the divorce. \"I haven't got my divorce certificate yet, because the law has a cooling-off period and we are now in that period.\" One of her followers wrote that the money she paid her husband was \"worth every penny\", adding: \"Now it's your turn to see the world and live a vibrant, unrestrained life. Congratulations, Auntie - here's to a colourful and fulfilling future!\" She says it's hard to get a divorce because \"many of our laws in China are to protect the family. Women often dare not divorce because of family disharmony\". At first, she thought that Du Zhoucheng's behaviour might improve with time and distance, but she said he still threw \"pots and pans\" at her on her return. He has only called her twice in the last few years – once because her highway access card was tied to his credit card and he wanted her to return 81 yuan (£0.90). She says she hasn't used that card since then. Undeterred by the delay in securing a divorce, Su Min keeps planning more trips and hopes to one day travel abroad. She's worried about overcoming language barriers, but is confident her story will resonate around the world - as it has in China. \"Although women in every country are different, I would like to say that no matter what environment you are in, you must be good to yourself. Learn to love yourself, because only when you love yourself can the world be full of sunshine.\"\n",

Pensioners, children under the age of five, people with health conditions and those who are pregnant are most at risk. So, staying safe and healthy must take priority, even when it puts pressure on the finances. That extends to checking gas appliances are safe to use when they may rarely be switched on. Family, friends and neighbours can play their part by ensuring anyone who is more vulnerable takes care when going out on icy pavements, or is well stocked up with food and medicines at home.\n",

      "\n",
      "Before having an argument between family or flatmates about the heating, try touring the property to work out how to save energy. That may include turning off radiators in unused rooms, switching lights off when they are not needed, and not leaving electrical appliances on standby. Curtains should be open during the day, then drawn at dusk. Manage your draughts by putting a black bag with scrunched up paper up an unused chimney, or try limiting other draughts around the home. You can easily make your own draught excluders. Cold, hard floors can be covered by a rug if you have one. Layer up with clothes, safely use a hot water bottle, and make sure you have warm nightwear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to heating, there is much debate about whether it is more efficient to keep it permanently on low, rather than switch it on and off when needed. Experts don't have a clear answer on that, as it often depends on circumstances in the home, but it probably isn't the best option for most people. Generally, a room temperature between 18C and 21C is ideal for most, but turning it down one degree can save money. For older people, and those with health conditions, it is best not to let temperatures drop below 18C in rooms used regularly. Making sure curtains are not sitting in front of radiators will help ensure the heat stays in, as will pushing furniture away from radiators. Consider fitting radiator reflector panels, although that may be a longer-term job.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is more important than ever to eat and drink properly, even with little motivation while stuck at home. Age UK says warming foods, like soup and stews, and hot drinks like tea can help keep you warm. People should try to have at least one hot meal a day and as many hot drinks as possible. Supermarket-branded tins may be cheaper, so keep a close eye on prices. Food banks can also help if you are short of money. Take care not to overfill the kettle by measuring out what is needed to keep costs down. Batch cooking can also help. Don't forget fruit and vegetables - the latter can be cooked with a steamer on one hob, rather than using different ones. When washing up, if your hot water is too hot to wash your hands in, then your setting is probably too high so turn the boiler down. Wash clothes at 30C, not 40C. Keep moving as much as you can between meals. That is likely to help your mental, as well as physical, health. As tempting as it is to soak in the shower for ages, experts suggest limiting the time to four minutes. A playlist of four-minute songs may help.\n",

      "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding. But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage. The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK. One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness. A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on. And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK. As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000. With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition – it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part. The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up. And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform – and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week. But how realistic is that ambition to win power – and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tactics and controversy\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct – they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions. I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did. Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.\n",

      "\n",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic – one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk. From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are – whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business). But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg? Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others. Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls – it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\". Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time. And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".\n",

      "So Farage has new friends and new energy – and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance. Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that – he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum. The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only £70,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file. Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament. As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.\n",

      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut £5 out of every £100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence. To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable. And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind – it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?\n",
      "\n",
      "Success - a distant prospect?\n",
      "\n",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment – they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025. Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour. He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\". Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away. And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man – born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the cliché that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives. In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go. Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress. In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May. A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed. Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.

      "REX/Shutterstock On Monday Vice-President Harris will certify Trump's election victory against her\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly two months after her election loss to Donald Trump, Vice-President Kamala Harris will preside over the certification of her own defeat. As president of the Senate, on Monday she will stand at the House Speaker's rostrum to lead the counting of Electoral College votes, officially cementing her rival's triumph two weeks before he returns to the White House. The circumstances are painful and awkward for a candidate who decried her opponent as an urgent threat to American democracy, but Harris aides insist she will conduct her constitutional and legal duty with seriousness and grace. It is not the first time a losing candidate will lead the joint session of Congress to count their opponent's presidential electors - Al Gore endured the indignity in 2001 and Richard Nixon in 1961.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's a fitting coda to an improbable election that saw Harris elevated from a back-up to the nation's oldest president to the Democratic standard bearer - whose fleeting campaign provided a jolt of hope to her party before a crushing loss exposed deep internal faultlines. Harris and her team are now deliberating her second act, and weighing whether it includes another run for the White House in 2028 or pursuing a bid for the governor's mansion in her home state of California. While recent Democratic candidates who lost elections - Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton - have decided against seeking the presidency again, aides, allies and donors argue that the groundswell of support Harris captured in her unsuccessful bid and the unusual circumstances of her condensed campaign proves there's still scope for her to seek the Oval Office. They even point to Donald Trump's own circuitous political path - the former and future president's bookend wins in 2016 and 2024, despite losing as the incumbent in 2020. But while many Democrats do not blame Harris for Trump's win, some - stung by a bruising loss that has called the party's strategy into question - are deeply sceptical of giving her another shot at the White House. A host of Democratic governors who coalesced behind the vice-president in 2024 but have ambitions of their own are seen by some strategists as fresher candidates with a much better chance of winning.\n",

      "Harris herself is said to be in no rush to make any decisions, telling advisers and supporters she is open to all the possibilities that await her after Inauguration Day on 20 January. She is assessing the last few months, which saw her launch an entirely new White House campaign, vet a running-mate, lead a party convention and barnstorm the country in just 107 days. And aides point out that she remains the US vice-president, at least for another two weeks. \"She has a decision to make and you can't make it when you're still on the treadmill. It may have slowed down – but she's on the treadmill until 20 January,\" said Donna Brazile, a close Harris ally who advised the campaign. \"You can't put anyone in a box. We didn't put Al Gore in a box and it was obvious the country was very divided after the 2000 election,\" said Brazile, who ran Gore's campaign against George W Bush and pointed to his second life as an environmental activist. \"All options are on the table because there's an appetite for change and I do believe that she can represent that change in the future.\" But the nagging question that shadows any potential 2028 run is whether the 60-year-old can separate herself from Joe Biden - something she failed to do in the election campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her allies in the party say that Biden's choice to seek re-election despite worries about his age, only then to ultimately drop out of the race with months to go, doomed her candidacy. Though Trump swept all seven battleground states and is the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote, his margin of victory was relatively narrow while Harris still won 75 million votes, an outcome her supporters argue can't be ignored as a currently faceless Democratic party rebuilds over the next four years. On the other side, those close to Biden remain convinced he could have defeated Trump again, despite surveys showing he had been bleeding support from key Democratic voting blocs. They point out that Harris fell short where the president didn't in 2020, underperforming with core Democratic groups like black and Latino voters. Critics continue to bring up her 2019 campaign to become the Democratic presidential nominee, which sputtered out in less than a year. \"People forget that had there been a real primary [in 2024], she never would have been the nominee. Everyone knows that,\" said one former Biden adviser. The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, applauded Harris for reviving the Democratic base and helping key congressional races, but said Trump's campaign successfully undercut her on critical campaign issues including the economy and the border.\n",

      "Reuters Biden and Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August, a high point for her campaign\n",
      "\n",
      "Members of Trump's team, however, including his chief pollster, have acknowledged that Harris performed stronger as a candidate than Biden on certain issues like the economy among voters. Yet there's no escaping that any Democratic primary contest for 2028 would be a tough fight, with rising stars like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and California Governor Gavin Newsom already weighing presidential runs. Some Democrats say that Harris would nonetheless start ahead of the pack, with national name recognition, a much-coveted mailing list and a deep bench of volunteers. \"What state party would not want her to come help them set the table for the 2026 midterm elections?\" Brazile said. \"She's going to have plenty opportunities not only to rebuild, but to strengthen the coalition that came together to support her in 2024.\" Others have suggested she could step out of the political arena entirely, running a foundation or establishing an institute of politics at her alma mater, Howard University, the Washington-based historically black college where she held her election night party. The former top state prosecutor could also be a contender for secretary of state or attorney general in a future Democratic administration. And she'll need to decide if she wants to write another book. For all of her options, Harris has told aides, she wants to remain visible and be seen as a leader in the party. One adviser suggested that she could exist outside the domestic political fray, taking on a more global role on an issue that matters to her, but that's a difficult perch without a platform as large as the vice-presidency.\n",

      "In the waning days of the Biden-Harris administration, she plans to embark on an international trip to multiple regions, according to a source familiar with the plans, signalling her desire to maintain a role on the world stage and build a legacy beyond being Biden's number two. For Harris and her team, the weeks since the election have been humbling, a mix of grief and resolve. Several aides described the three-month sprint that began when Biden dropped out as having begun with the campaign \"digging out of a hole\" and ending with their candidate more popular than when she began, even if she didn't win. \"There's a sense of peace knowing that given the hand we were dealt, we ran through the tape,\" said one senior aide. Following the election, Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, spent a week in Hawaii with a small group of aides to relax and discuss her future. During a staff holiday party at her official residence before Christmas, Harris recounted election night and how she delivered a pep talk to her family as the results became clear. \"We are not having a pity party!\" she told the crowd of her reaction that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advisers and allies say she is still processing what happened, and wants to wait and see how the new administration unfolds in January before staking out any position, let alone seeking to become the face of any so-called Trump \"resistance\". Democrats have found the resistance movement that took off among liberals in the wake of his 2016 win no longer resonates in today's political climate, where the Republican has proven that his message and style appeals to a huge cross-section of Americans. They have adopted a more conciliatory approach in confronting the incoming president's agenda. As several Democrats put it: \"What resistance?\" Though she's kept a relatively low profile since her loss, Harris provided a glimpse of her mindset at an event for students at Prince George's Community College in Maryland in December. \"The movements for civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights, the United States of America itself, would never have come to be if people had given up their cause after a court case, or a battle, or an election did not go their way,\" she said. \"We must stay in the fight,\" she added, a refrain she has repeated since her 2016 Senate win. \"Everyone of us.\"\n",

First, the ground rules: you stick to a healthy diet with no cheat meals or alcohol. Plus on each of the 75 days, you do two 45-minute workouts, one of them outside, drink more than three litres of water and read 10 pages of a non-fiction book. Easy, right?

While 75 Hard has turned into a viral craze over the last few weeks, it was actually invented back in 2019 by author and podcaster Andy Frisella. He said on his podcast that he's spent \"20 years figuring out how to master mental toughness\" and has used this knowledge to create the plan. He is not a qualified personal trainer or doctor and does not give guidance over what classifies as a healthy diet in the plan, but it's understood to mean balanced and nutrient-rich. More relaxed variations of the challenge have been popping up on social media recently, called 75 Soft and 75 Medium, in which participants can have the odd alcoholic drink and unhealthy meal while still doing exercise and reading.\n",

Sophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app. She found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.\n",

      "\"It was something that, at first, would always really excite me, but has become increasingly something of a pet peeve,\" said bookseller and fantasy blogger Bethan Hindmarch, from Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire. \"Tolkien was the one who opened that floodgate [and] Terry Pratchett always did it in a great way. His own daughter has a Welsh name, and it was about honouring [the language] and being respectful. \"But you do get authors who want their fantasy to sound more mystical, magical and made up.\" Prof Dimitra Fimi, a lecturer in fantasy and children's literature at Glasgow University, and lived and taught in Cardiff for more than 20 years, said the genre was \"particularly good at connecting us with the past in imaginative ways\". \"Fantasy has - definitely in the last couple of centuries - been consciously playing with myths, legends, folk tales... Wales in particular has a very rich tradition in terms of that and there is a chain of key fantasy authors that have played around with that material.\" She said, for Tolkien, Welsh language was the main influence, particularly in his more popular works. \"If you think of Sindarin - one of the two main Elvish languages - it's very much based on the phonology and grammar, at points, of Welsh,\" she said. \"I think what happened is you get a generation of writers after Tolkien who want to write fantasy, [but] they don't want to replicate what Tolkien has done.\"\n",

      "Bethan Hindmarch Bookseller and blogger Bethan Hindmarch says use of Welsh words by non-Welsh authors is increasingly becoming a \"pet peeve\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the natural starting point for many authors was their own, often Welsh, roots, and the impact on awareness of Welsh language and culture was huge. \"It's a positive thing in terms of discovering a very rich new culture or opening up to other perspectives [but] what worries me is a particular perception of Wales that is developing within fantasy, which is that it's this magical, rural, romantic place. \"It can be pretty patronising, it creates an image of the country which isn't realistic. That's not all that Wales is.\" Ms Hindmarch said she hated the \"snobbery\" which could surround books such as ACOTAR and other fantasy sagas made mainstream by social media. \"I have always been a bookworm. I will read a bit of anything, but fantasy is my niche because it's escapist,\" she said. \"Other genres really looked down on it and now within fantasy there is snobbery towards so-called romantasy books, and it really upsets me. \"It brings a whole host of new readers to the genre. I have people coming into my shop who would normally never have come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pay a bit more respect'\n",
      "\n",
      "As a teacher on the only fantasy literature masters course in the world, Prof Fimi had seen the genre \"expanding and developing into more hybrid genres\" and \"moving away from the Tolkien model\". But, while they acknowledged some authors had evidently done their research well, both women said issues could arise when distinctions were not clearly made between something inspired by Wales, and being authentically Welsh. \"There's a pan-Celticism sort of situation that has developed in fantasy, where everybody thinks that all of that can be thrown in together - that's Gaelic, Irish, Welsh, Manx, Cornish, the lot - and it just becomes one big amalgamation and anybody can pick anything they want out of that pot,\" said Prof Fimi. Ms Hindmarch added that Celtic languages could sometimes be used sloppily, citing the blunder by Fourth Wing author Rebecca Yarros, where she was forced to apologise after using Scottish Gaelic names but mispronouncing them. \"People assume if you're an author, you know what you're talking about. It doesn't take much to get a sensitivity reader, do your research, and pay a bit more respect.\" She recalled sending a message to one self-published author who had used Welsh terms, asking about his inspiration and whether he was a Welsh learner, only to be told he \"just liked the sound of it\".\n",

      "PA Media Bad weather can cause travel disruption for passengers, as seen at the end of 2024 in the UK (file photo from 2017)\n",
      "\n",
      "Passengers at British airports have faced travel chaos on multiple occasions over the last few weeks, from heavy winds to fog. Now, the Met Office has issued an amber warning for snow and ice in the Midlands, north of England and Wales, which says that delays and cancellations to air travel are \"expected\". It can seem a mystery to many frustrated flyers that a brief spell of bad weather can upend schedules, especially since British weather isn't exactly famed for being the best. So why, with all the technological advancements of planes and airports in recent years, do flights get affected so badly?\n",
      "\n",
      "How efficiency can quickly turn to chaos\n",
      "\n",
      "While planes are designed to deal with the likes of snow and ice, fog and high winds, air traffic control often imposes strict safety limits in these situations. As a result, \"airports go into a kind of slow motion\" with the spacing between arriving and departing aircraft increased, says travel expert Simon Calder. If the conditions \"require air-traffic controllers to increase the spacing between aircraft by 50%, capacity is immediately reduced by one third – and cancellations begin,\" he adds. There's little slack in the system, as when things are running smoothly, schedules at London Heathrow - Europe's busiest airport - are based on landing aircraft as close as 80 seconds apart. And London Gatwick, the UK's second busiest airport, can facilitate a take-off or landing every 65 seconds. The spacing between arriving and departing aircraft was increased at London Gatwick last weekend during the fog, which Mr Calder estimates led to about 75,000 passengers being affected. Among them were James and Madison King, whose flight from Stockholm to London took a lengthy diversion because of the fog-related spacing limits. They were within touching distance of home when the pilot announced they did not have enough fuel for a 50-minute holding pattern at Gatwick, so the plane diverted to Dublin to refuel. Flight crew shift limits then meant all the passengers had to fly back to where they started in the Swedish capital. James says he still hasn't been reimbursed for the £200 he spent on a hotel and dinner during this impromptu additional overnight stay in Stockholm.\n",
      "\n",
      "James King/ Madison King James and Madison King were delayed over Christmas\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathrow also saw delays and cancellations during high winds before Christmas. Despite some airports trialling artificial intelligence to help planes land in low visibility, controllers in on-the-ground towers still need to clearly see an aircraft arriving before issuing a landing clearance, aviation expert Scott Bateman MBE wrote on X. He says the majority of modern aircraft can automatically land in the worst fog, but that in practice visibility limits are imposed so pilots can see sufficiently to taxi off the runway. Elif Arjin Celik's flight from London Gatwick to Istanbul was delayed for hours because of poor visibility in the fog on 28 December 2024. She saw thousands of people waiting in the terminal with nowhere to sit, and says it was \"grim\" having to wait 20 minutes to use the toilet because of the \"extreme overcrowding\". With upcoming warnings of snow, Mr Calder advises passengers to brace for more disruption to their flights because of spacing limits and runway closures. \"The UK has seen some shocking snow closures, where big airports have simply not been able to cope,\" he says, citing an incident in 2010 where hundreds of thousands of passengers saw cancellations at Heathrow because of snow. Snow also caused Manchester Airport to close both its runways in December 2022 and again in January 2023, with flights diverted as far away as Dublin and Paris. Although the extreme cost of disruption on this scale has led to British airports investing more in hardware and training to clear snow quicker, don't expect us to cope like airports in places such as Iceland and Greenland. Mr Calder says we might never be as good as other countries at keeping an efficient schedule in unusual weather. \"Historically the UK has had a benign climate,\" he says. \"Spending millions preparing for an unlikely event has been hard to justify.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Disruption could grow\n",
      "\n",
      "There's not great news on the horizon because in the future, we can expect more disruption from weather related to climate change, says Dr Ella Gilbert, a climate expert from the British Antarctic Survey. \"Aviation tends to be most impacted by extreme precipitation and stormy weather that makes flying unsafe - two weather types that are enhanced by higher temperatures,\" she says. She adds that climate heating increases the frequency and intensity of rain and snowfall events, making storms \"stronger and more frequent\" and increasing the frequency of aircraft turbulence. Nats, the national air traffic service, is allowed to take action to reduce the amount of planes in the sky and space them apart more during adverse weather under the Transport Act 2000. Given this is part of Nats' obligation to prioritise safety over all other factors, it doesn't have to compensate airlines for these restrictions - which in turn means airlines don't need to compensate passengers for the resulting delays either. The organisation told the BBC that it recognises there's a tough balancing act. \"Flow regulations are only ever employed when absolutely necessary and have to be expertly timed,\" a Nats spokesperson said. \"Unexpected additional or delayed air traffic can increase the pressure on controllers, particularly when the weather clears. \"If restrictions are lifted too early, they can risk an overpopulated airspace, while on the flip side, restrictions remaining in place longer than they need to can lead to unnecessary delays, which no one wants.\" This is brought into sharp focus during storms, Nats explained. \"Fundamentally, pilots don't want to fly through storms,\" it told the BBC. \"Although aircraft are robust, storms can still affect aircraft systems and excessive winds within unstable storm clouds make it much more difficult for aircraft to maintain their levels. It also increases turbulence, which negatively impacts passenger comfort.\" This leads to planes being in unexpected parts of the sky at different times, and all these new routes needing to be recalibrated to avoid any collisions. Nats says it does have measures to mitigate disruption, including specialist Met Office weather equipment which can help foresee the need for safety limits to be imposed, while pilots also have more tech on board to help them fly around bad weather patches and inform air traffic controllers of potential issues.\n",

      "\n",
      "Plot twists are happening already in season three of the BBC's The Traitors, as one contestant from London lifted the lid on her charming - but false - Welsh accent. Charlotte, 33, has lived in London her whole life but has decided to pretend she is from Abergavenny, in Monmouthshire, to maximise her chances of survival. \"I've been putting on a Welsh accent because my mum's from Wales, it's one of the most trustworthy accents,\" she told the camera on New Year's Day. But is a Welsh lilt really the key to gaining people's trust as a faithful in the show - and perhaps in life in general?\n",
      "\n",
      "The reality show centres around traitors selected by host Claudia Winkleman, who must deceive and gain the trust of other contestants, who are faithfuls. Dr Mercedes Durham, a sociolinguistics professor at Cardiff University, led research into the likeability of the Welsh accent and found people associate the accent with being friendly - but not necessarily clever. \"They genuinely appreciated it, they find it funny, attractive and friendly, but they didn't take it seriously or associate it with intelligence,\" said Dr Durham. But friendliness and trustworthiness are linked, says Dr Durham, so there could be a method behind the mask.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspiration may have come from previous Welsh contestants Andrew Jenkins from Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Amanda Lovett, from Swansea, who both eliminated faithfuls and narrowly missed out on The Traitors trophy in series one and two. Amanda sailed through the first series in 2023, with her opponents swearing hand on heart that the humble character could never be a traitor. \"I think the Welsh accent is very relaxing, it definitely played a role in people trusting me in being a motherly figure,\" said Amanda. \"Maybe they didn't think I would be sharp enough, or the type capable of murdering, that I was too naive maybe,\" she added. \"But I don't know if I agree with pinching our Welsh accent,\" Amanda laughed, \"we are very proud of our Welsh heritage\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Amanda Lovett says her warm accent helped her make it to the end of the Bafta-winning series in 2023\n",
      "\n",
      "Amanda said Traitors fans may even be wary of Welsh contestants this time, as both her and Andrew took their charming accents to the very end. Andrew agreed the Welsh accent is trustworthy, but said he would have spotted Charlotte's fake effort from a mile off. \"Oh, I think it's terrible, she keeps dipping in and out of her London accent,\" he said. \"I just think the Welsh are lovely, friendly, trusting people, I went in and was authentic. \"I tried to make as many friends as I could and be myself to be honest, I think that helped.\"\n",

      "Lamberty Paul Chappells Andrew Jenkins says Charlotte's fake Welsh accent isn't convincing, and believes being authentic is the best way to go\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte is not the only Welsh person in the game this year, as Cardiff-based Elen is from north Wales and Leanne is from Holywell in Flintshire. There is a lot of variation in Welsh accents, and people tend to relate more to certain regions, according to Dr Durham. \"The main association of people outside of Wales is the south Wales valleys and Barry Island in the Vale of Glamorgan, thanks to Gavin & Stacey,\" she said. \"Possibly more than the other two contestants, it's an accent outsiders will associate the most with Wales.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "BBC/PA North Wales-born Elen was thrilled when Charlotte told her she was a fellow Welsh person in the game\n",
      "\n",
      "The Welsh accent has enticed new contact centres to set up or expand in Wales in recent years, including Starling Bank, Capital on Tap, Veezu and TCH Group. One firm chose Newport, over Middlesbrough, Teesside, to open its funeral planning business, because of the \"consoling\" and \"empathetic\" Welsh accent. Sandra Busby, chief executive of Cnect Wales, which supports contact centres, said Wales has always been an attractive location for many reasons with accents \"playing their part\". \"Over the years the Welsh accent always comes in the top three regional accent surveys for friendliness and for being trustworthy,\" she added.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Welsh accent took top spot for the most relaxing accent across the UK in 2024, in a study by the University of Sheffield and Spa Seekers. The public have a soft spot for all Celtic accents, Irish and Scottish included, thanks to their friendly connotations, said Dr Durham. Received pronunciation, also known as Queen's English, does well to gain people's trust, but mainly because of its social prestige. But Birmingham, Liverpudlian and Cockney accents are often not favoured and can be found in the lower half of popularity polls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mercedes Durham Prof Mercedes Durham is leading research into Welsh accents\n",
      "\n",
      "Trust in accents can change over time depending on our social circles and daily relationships, according to a study by Ilaria Torre from Plymouth University. Participants heard either a standard southern English accent or a \"lesser trusted\" Liverpudlian accent, and attitudes changed depending on first impressions and judgements. If a person who spoke in a \"trusted\" accent went on to behave fairly, then this first impression of trustworthiness increased. Yet if they went on to behave unfairly, they were seen as less trustworthy than those who had both a lesser trusted accent and behaviour. Participants \"were punishing them, so to speak, for not living up to the participants' expectations\", said Ms Torre. On the opposite side, those who were seen as sounding \"untrustworthy\" with a Liverpudlian accent but acted nicely were able to reverse negative preconceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while a Welsh lilt might start you off in good stead as a trusted contestant, the odds are still all to play for. With a mixture of different accents from across the UK, how will the Welsh ones do?\n",

      "A tiny Sutton Hoo-era gold and garnet mount for an Anglo-Saxon warrior's sword belt has been found during a metal detecting event. Treasure expert Helen Geake described the find as one of \"probably less than a dozen in the country\" and \"only the fifth\" on the British Museum's Portable Antiquities database. The late 6th to early 7th Century mount, or boss, was unearthed during an event organised by Digging History UK near King's Lynn, Norfolk. Paul Mortimer, who has created replicas of weapons found at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk - where an Anglo-Saxon burial ship was discovered - said it probably attached a sword scabbard to a warrior's belt \"with some form of very thin fabric or leather\".\n",

      "\"Swords are usually detachable from the belts in some way and it [the boss] was probably used to help attach the belt to the sword - that's what I've done with the Sutton Hoo replica,\" said the retired teacher, who lives near Chelmsford in Essex.\n",

She speculated it might have been a peace band, which were referenced in the Norse Sagas. The sagas retell stories from the Viking era, but were written hundreds of years after the events, from 1200 onwards. \"Unfastening a peace band is something you had to do before taking a sword out of a scabbard... to make someone go through a step before taking out their sword, to stop violence erupting quickly,\" Dr Geake said.\n",

      "The former model began to have pains in spring 2023, which she initially put down to period problems, before an ultrasound revealed an ovarian cyst. However, after an operation to rectify the problems, she said she \"heard the dreaded C-word\" and was diagnosed with pseudomyxoma peritonei – a rare tumour that causes a build-up of a jelly-like substance in the abdomen. As the tumour had ruptured, spreading cancer cells around her body, Ms Louise needed an operation which involved removing eight of her organs. The surgery included the removal of her spleen, gallbladder, appendix, ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, belly button, greater and lesser omentum - which connect the stomach and duodenum to other abdominal organs - and part of her liver, as well as the scraping of her diaphragm and pelvis. She will continue to have yearly scans every November as a result. \"Waiting for the results will sadly make or break every Christmas for me. But you just have to keep pushing forward and never give up,\" she said. \"Some days I have been down to the depths of despair, but more often than not now, I'm having more positive days.\"\n",

      "Content: Luke Littler ref makes history as gay darts official\n",
      "\n",
      "BBC Huw Ware became the first openly gay referee to officiate a World Darts Championship final\n",
      "\n",
      "A referee has spoken of his pride at becoming the first openly gay man to officiate a PDC World Darts Championship final as he oversaw Luke Littler's victory. Huw Ware, from Cardiff, took charge of the second half of the match as Littler demolished Michael Van Gerwen to become the youngest ever PDC World Championship winner. Huw hopes his success will help to break down barriers after \"struggling at times\" in the early stages of his career. He said he wants to \"inspire the next generation\" of players, officials or even fans and ensure that the sport he loves is a welcome space for everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Huw has been with the Professional Darts Corporation for eight years. He said it had been a \"tough journey\" at times as one of the few openly gay figures in the sport. \"Especially in my early years I went through a lot and it was a big struggle at times. But what has been amazing to me is to have seen the changes that darts has gone through over the years, to a place now where it is a lot better than what it was when I first joined.\" Huw said that despite the issues he faced \"days like yesterday mean it was worthwhile\", adding that it was \"the biggest day of my life\". \"It was one of the biggest honours of my life to take charge of the second half and call in the champion.\" The 31-year-old said it was important to see people from the LGBTQ+ community in high profile positions at sporting events. Especially sports such as darts which traditionally have a \"macho\" culture. \"The best thing that I could offer is visibility. We've all seen some of the vitriol that some players have got for coming out. It's important for a ref to put yourself forward as well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "PDC Huw called in the new champion as Luke Littler became the youngest ever PDC World Championship winner\n",
      "\n",
      "He remembers being \"inspired\" by fellow Welshman and Rugby World Cup referee, Nigel Owens, who revealed his sexuality in 2007. \"He broke down barriers for me back when he refereed the World Cup final in 2015. I felt like I had a lot in common with him. I could look at him and say 'he has got to the pinnacle and so can I'. Huw added that darts, but also sport in general, still has some way to go to be inclusive for all. \"We look at everything that's going on with the LGBTQ+ discussion in sport these days, the fires are still very much raging. I hope that I can help to break down barriers for the next generation.\" Prior to officiating the final, Huw wrote on his blog that if he could say anything it would be to \"gay boys or gay girls out there who are worried that their sexuality could close doors to worlds they would like to be in but no longer feel that they can, then that is not the case\". He added that \"worlds, such as the sports world, were open to everybody both gay and straight, no matter who you are you can achieve in any world you want to, and most importantly, you can belong\".\n",
